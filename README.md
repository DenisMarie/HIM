This repository contains the R code for fitting the Hierarchical Integrative Model (HIM) developed in "A Bayesian two-step integrative procedure incorporating prior
knowledge for the identification of miRNA-mRNAs involved in hepatocellular carcinoma" (doi: 10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871330).

`functions_final.R` file contains all R functions required for running the main function HIM. 

`HIM.R` file contains the R code for running the HIM model. 

`call.R` file is a R script to run the HIM function on a simulated example.
